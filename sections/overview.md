## Overview

The Columbus Italian Club has a central audio system that integrates multiple sources and routes sound to discrete locations including the main clubhouse area, the back room, and to the outdoor bocce courts.  The matrix routing is handled by the Behringer xAir XR16 digital mixing console which is controlled jointly by the iPads in the main clubhouse and the back room--all audio levels are controlled by these devices.
